                    <h4 class="legal-paragraph-heading">Basis for Our Recommendations</h4>
                    <p>Recommendations are presented to you based on your investment objectives and risk appetite. Our Financial Professionals work with clients to determine the investments that meet the clients’ goals and desires. We ask that you provide information on your investment profile which includes your age, other investments, financial situation and needs, tax status, investment objectives, investment experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and any other information that you feel is relevant in connection with the recommendations that you would like to be provided.</p>

                    <h4 class="legal-paragraph-heading">Risks Associated With Recommendations</h4>
                    <p>While the stock market or a specific investment may increase and clients’ accounts could enjoy a gain, it is also possible that the stock market or a specific investment may decrease and clients’ accounts could suffer a loss.  It is important that clients understand that all investment activities involve a degree of risks, including the possible risk of loss of their entire investment, as well as the gains earned thereon.  Securities investments are not guaranteed and you may lose money on your investments. Investing in securities involves a high risk of loss that clients should be prepared to bear.  We ask that you work with us to help us understand your tolerance for risk.</p>

                <div class="legal-paragraph">
                    <h4 class="legal-paragraph-heading">Conflicts of Interest</h4>
                    <p>ACP’s Financial Professionals are compensated by receiving a percentage of the product sales commission you are charged. This creates a conflict in that there is an incentive to conduct more transactions to generate more commission. Some of ACP’s associated persons are also licensed as insurance brokers that would earn additional commission if a client was to purchase insurance through them. In addition, some private placement products are managed by a related firm that will earn additional fees on their management of the investments.  These conflicts are fully disclosed in the individual private placement memorandums.  ACP is also a market maker and from time to time may make a market in a particular security.  ACP could make money trading that security to and from customers.</p>
